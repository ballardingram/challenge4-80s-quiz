# Challenge 4 - Quiz
This website was built to showcase my Javascript and Web API skills by building a Quiz with a timer, scoreboard, correct and wrong question indicators, and style. It will be submitted as a part of Challenge 4 for my UT Full Stack Bootcamp.

## Built With
This website was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I pulled from JQUERY, Bootstrap, and Popper. I used VS Code to write and edit the code. I used the DOM and Chrome's Dev Tools to make functional and style changes that would improve the User Experience. The style was intentionally designed to be 8-BIT inspired because of the 80s theme this had. Everything from the questions, the favicon, the font, to the background image is inspired by an DOS-ish 8-bit feel. It creates a simplistic approach to the quiz.

## Contributions
This was largely and independent project. I worked with askBCS and researched a lot of code structures to finalize this overall layout and flow  for the quiz.

## Observations
This was very difficult to get elements to show/hide and trigger when they are supposed to. In my research there were a lot of ways you could do something like this, none of them easier than others, none of them better than others. I had about five (5) versions of this quiz and even changed the theme a few times. The original version was a U.S. States Quiz, then as I added styles it changed to an 80s style arcade quiz. I used askBCS because when users would select an answer, the style of the button would change dramatically and stay there on the next question. That would be very confusing for a user trying to work on a quiz. With the undestanding it should change, I had too much reference code in my HTML that did not need to be there. Creating a minimal look still requires a lot of code.

## Challenges
The math for the questions and the timer. That is something I am going to need a lot of practice with.
