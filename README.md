# Challenge 4 - Quiz
This website was built to showcase my Javascript and Web API skills by building a Quiz with a timer, scoreboard, correct and wrong question indicators, and style. It will be submitted as a part of Challenge 4 for my UT Full Stack Bootcamp.

## Built With
This website was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I pulled from JQUERY, Bootstrap, and Popper. I used VS Code to write and edit the code. I used the DOM and Chrome's Dev Tools to make functional and style changes that would improve the User Experience. The style was intentionally designed to be 8-BIT inspired because of the 80s theme this had. Everything from the questions, the favicon, the font, to the background image is inspired by an DOS-ish 8-bit feel. It creates a simplistic approach to the quiz.
